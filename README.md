# Web-Scraping
wk13_mars

Using Selenium, Flask, MongoDB, HTML/Bootstrap I created a web dashboard for a variety of Mars images and facts that can be updated by clicking a button.
There are a series of functions and scripts written to actively pull the dynamic data from several different sites including Twitter and official NASA pages, to get up-to-date images and facts.
